                "<p>The Φ account system is based on asymmetric cryptography, specifically, ECDSA technology</p>",
                "<p>Each user can create a unique Φ account by himself/herself. A Φ account is a privatekey – namekey (publickey) pair. Namekey represents the Φ account, and digital signatures signed by private key proofs the control of the Φ account and triggers digital operations</p>",
                "<p>A Φ account is fully owned and controlled by the user only. No website, organization, or government is able to access your Φ accounts</p>",
                "<p>The absence of any link between Φ account and real world personal information ensures ultimate anonymity</p>",
                "<p>Φ account is free. The zero cost to create, possess, use and abandon as many Φ accounts as needed ensures ultimate freedom</p>",
                "<p>Φ accounts are compatible with all kinds of digital system and are extremely easy to implement. \"One account for any app\" will become true in the near future</p>",

                "<p>Φ network system is based on P2P technology, aka decentralized network</p>",
                "<p>Φ network has no centers. Every node in the Φ network is equal. Users can communicate point-to-point, or broadcast and relay Φ information</p>",
                "<p>Because of the cascade spreading of Φ information in the Φ network, there's no way to block, censor or modify Φ information</p>",
                "<p>Also because of the cascade-spreading of Φ information in the Φ network, it's extremely difficult to track the origin of Φ information. Ultimate anonymity is ensured meanwhile</p>",
                "<p>Any digital device can join the Φ network by following the basic Φ network protocol. Many kinds of apps can run on Φ network, even without a server</p>",
                "<h4>Φ Database</h4>",
                "<p>The Φ database system is based on blockchain technology</p>",
                "<p>There's always only one valid version of Φ database in the whole network, while many node/digital devices keep a full copy of it</p>",
                "<p>No Φ information can be deleted, because every node in the Φ network has a full copy of the Φ database </p>",
                "<p>Φ information following Φ database rules will go into Φ database after confirmed by Φ miners. The Φ database rules strictly require digital signature from the sender of the Φ information, so that no one else can modify the Φ information, i.e. the Φ information will be stored in the Φ database as what it is forever. Because of the decentrality of miners, there’s no way to block any valid Φ information going into Φ database</p>",
                "<p>Because everybody has exactly the same copy of Φ database, there're no ways to know what data a user has browsed. Ultimate anonymity is ensured</p>",
                "<p>The Φ database is open for any kind of digital information, including not only text, image, video, but also programs, settings, operation commands, etc</p>",
                "<h4>Φ Currency</h4>",
                "<p>The Φ currency system is based on Bitcoin technology</p>",
                "<p>The Φ currency is published and distributed independently on Φ system. It has no relationship with traditional currencies, so it's independent from any traditional banking and financial system</p>",
                "<p>Any Φ account can receive and send Φ currency. Naturally, the Φ currency system inherits the freedom and anonymity of Φ account </p>",
                "<p>A unique advantage of Φ currency system is that, the currency transaction is processed together with information and operation commands on the Φ system. It is unimaginably easy for merchants or app developers to integrate currency functions into their programs<p>"
